## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
To address the information gap faced by small and marginal farmers in India, we propose the development of a multilingual, AI-powered mobile advisory platform—a smart virtual assistant accessible through both a mobile app and a voice-enabled chatbot. The solution will be designed to deliver personalized, real-time agricultural guidance by leveraging data from multiple sources, including weather APIs, soil databases, crop calendars, and satellite imagery.

Key Components of the Solution

Multilingual Support

The platform will offer content and interaction in major Indian languages (e.g., Punjabi, Hindi, Tamil), ensuring inclusivity and ease of use.

AI-Based Crop Advisory

Personalized crop recommendations based on location, soil health, season, and previous crop cycles.

Continuous learning from user feedback and data patterns.

Soil Health and Fertilizer Guidance

Users can input or upload soil test reports.

The system recommends optimal fertilizer use to prevent overuse and reduce costs.

Weather-Integrated Alerts

Real-time, location-based weather alerts.

Predictive insights for irrigation, pest outbreaks, and crop planning.

Pest & Disease Detection Using Computer Vision

Farmers upload images of affected crops.

AI models identify pests/diseases and suggest treatment using integrated image recognition.

Market Price Tracking

Displays nearby market prices for selected crops.

Helps farmers make informed selling decisions.

Voice and Offline Support

Voice-based interaction for low-literacy users.

Core features available offline with periodic syncing when internet is available.

Data Analytics and Feedback Loop

Continuous improvement through user engagement and system usage patterns.

Insights shared with agriculture departments and policymakers for macro-level planning.
