## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The solution is a multilingual, AI-powered mobile advisory platform (app + chatbot) designed for small and marginal farmers. It provides personalized, real-time, and location-specific crop advisory based on soil type, weather forecasts, and crop history. The platform supports voice interaction, image-based pest detection, and market insights, making it accessible to farmers with low literacy or digital skills.

How It Addresses the Problem

Provides tailored agricultural guidance instead of guesswork

Uses real-time weather and soil data for accurate recommendations

Reduces chemical overuse through science-backed fertilizer and pest control advice

Encourages sustainable and profitable farming practices

Supports regional languages and voice inputs to overcome language and literacy barriers

Innovation and Uniqueness of the Solution

Combines AI, geospatial data, and local knowledge in a single platform

Offers image-based pest/disease detection using machine learning

Provides voice-enabled assistance in regional languages

Works in low-connectivity rural environments with offline capabilities

Integrates feedback loops to continuously improve advisories based
## Technical Approach
Frontend: Flutter / React Native for Android-first cross-platform mobile development

Backend: Node.js or Python (FastAPI/Django) for scalable REST APIs

AI/ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch for image-based pest/disease recognition

NLP: Indic NLP models for multilingual chatbot and voice-to-text functionality

Voice Tech: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Mozilla DeepSpeech for low-literate user support

Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for location-based services

Cloud Services: AWS/GCP for hosting, scalability, and AI model deployment

APIs: IMD for weather data, AgMarket for price data, government soil databases
## Technically Feasible: Uses proven, widely available technologies

Financially Viable: Can be launched as a government-backed digital public good or PPP model

Operationally Scalable: Uses existing farmer networks and local extension workers for adoption

Potential Challenges and Risks
Challenge	Mitigation Strategy
Low smartphone penetration	Provide kiosk-based or IVR/voice bot access
Resistance to new technology	Use local champions, SHGs, and demonstration farms
Poor data quality in some regions	Partner with satellite-based agri platforms and remote sensing
Language coverage	Prioritize regional languages, community-driven translationsFeasibility and Viability
